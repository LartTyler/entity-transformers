## Installation
In your project root, run the following command.

```shell
$ composer require dbstudios/entity-transformers
```

If you plan on using the built-in `AbstractEntityTransformer` class, you'll also need to make sure that `doctrine/orm`
is required by your project.

```shell
$ composer require doctrine/orm
```
